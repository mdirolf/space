A space simulator that I worked on a long time ago. Managed to get it to build
and thought I'd post it for kicks.

BUILDING
--------
You'll need SDL. I'm building on a OS X 10.5 and using the macports version
of SDL:
> sudo port install libsdl

Run:
> make

RUNNING
-------
Hopefully this will build cleanly, but your mileage may vary. If it does you
should be able to do:
> ./game
to run the game.

There isn't much in terms of gameplay. You drive the orange ship around and
the blue ships follow you. Maybe I'll revisit this thing someday.

FEEDBACK
--------
If you have any questions or feedback contact me at (mike at dirolf dot com)
